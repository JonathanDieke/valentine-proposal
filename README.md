# Valentine's Day Proposal App

A fun and interactive React application built with Vite for a playful Valentine's Day proposal.

## Features

- **Interactive Proposal**: Displays a heartfelt question: "Mel, will you be my Valentine? 💖"
- **Playful "No" Button**: The "No" button cleverly moves away from the cursor when hovered near, making it hard to click. It wraps around the screen edges for continuous evasion.
- **Growing "Yes" Button**: The "Yes" button increases in size by 5% each time the cursor hovers over it, encouraging the user to click it.
- **Celebration Screen**: Upon clicking "Yes", a victory message and GIF are displayed.

## Technologies Used

- React 19
- Vite
- CSS for styling

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
3. Open your browser to the provided URL.

## Project Structure

- `src/App.jsx`: Main component with interactive logic
- `src/MyCss.css`: Styling for the app
